# Day 5: Strings and f-Strings

# Ask for name and age
name = input("What's your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")

# Basic string concatenation
print("Hello " + name + ", you are " + age + " years old.")

# Using f-strings (cleaner and more readable)
print(f"Nice to meet you, {name}. You are {age} years young!")

# Practice challenge
city = input("Which city do you live in? ")
print(f"{name} lives in {city}.")
